This mod is a project my brother and I work on whenever we feel like it, so... sorry if there's active maintainance.
It mostly changes things we dislike about the game and and adds a few new features, small changes were made to most bosses as well.
Please keep in mind that this mod was made just for fun and might not be very balanced or serious at times.

-A few new weapons (Including two new summons)
