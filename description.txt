Hey there! This mod is a project my brother and I will be working on In our free time, or whenever we feel like it! It's just us messing around, changing stuff we dislike about the game and maybe adding something new.

Also it's me trying to get into Coding.

-I've got 3 more swords planned, actually coming soon
-Star warth arrows (Soon (TM))

-Lukas

That's all, thanks for reading.

Oh boy, Here we go - Chaaaangelog!
