This mod is a project my brother and I are working on whenever we feel like it.

It mostly changes things we dislike about the game and and adds a few new features, small changes were made to most bosses as well.

Please keep in mind that this mod was made just for fun and isn't meant to be too serious.


List of additions and changes:
-Four new weapons (Two melee weapons, one ranged weapon, one summon weapon)
-Searing armor, a classless tank set
-A lot of reforges, some better, some worse
-Some new accessories (usually focused on one class)
-Tons of stat balance changes to both bosses and items
-Changes to some of the bosses (Example: The destroyer's projectiles ignore walls)
-Mechanics to slow down game progression with the intent of prolonging Hardmode
-Buffs to fishing to make the mechanic genuinely useful
-Debuffs inflicted by powerful enemies and bosses to prevent cheesing


This Mod features compatibility/crossover features with Thorium Mod:
- Increased health for Thorium Bosses
- Thorium Hardmode Bosses inflict debuffs that prevent cheesing as well
- Exclusive Beam Laser Weapons that are only accessible when playing with Thorium Mod
