Mod created by my brother and I to add a few silly things and make some minor tweaks to the vanilla game. 
As this is purely a passion project, it will not be updated and worked on consistently,
and its sense of humor is not tailored to mainstream or in some cases conventionally sane audiences. 
Cinfu and affiliates are not liable for anyone possibly offended or perplexed by the death messages.

List of additions and changes the mod might include:
-A few new accessories and weapons
-A classless set of defense focused armor
-Various reforges with sometimes unique effects
-Minor balance changes to some items and bosses
-AI changes to some enemies to go along with this
-Buffs to fishing
-Changes to the generation of the underground for better caving
-Disabled world evil creeping and non-consumable boss summons
-A set of absurd death messages that I should add a config for

Thanks to DarkWav there are also some minor adjustments to and compatibility with Thorium content,
which are, however, not remarkable enough to elaborate on here.
